# MySQL LIMIT Clause - Complete Study Notes

---

##  What is LIMIT Clause?

### Definition
The LIMIT clause is used to **control the number of records returned by a query**. It's essential for:
- Preventing server overload when dealing with large tables
- Implementing pagination
- Getting top N results
- Testing queries on production servers safely

### Why Use LIMIT?
```sql
--  Dangerous on large tables
SELECT * FROM products;

--  Safe and efficient
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 10;
```

---

##  Basic Syntax

### Simple LIMIT
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT [number_of_rows];
```

### Example
```sql
-- Get first 2 products
SELECT * FROM products 
ORDER BY id 
LIMIT 2;
```

**Result:**
| id | name | price | category |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | Laptop | 999.99 | Electronics |
| 2 | Smartphone | 499.99 | Electronics |

##  OFFSET - Skip Records

### Definition
OFFSET specifies **how many rows to skip** before returning results. Essential for pagination.

### Two Syntax Options

#### Option 1: LIMIT with OFFSET keyword
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT [row_count] OFFSET [skip_count];
```

#### Option 2: Shortcut syntax
```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT [skip_count], [row_count];
```

### Examples
```sql
-- Skip first 2 records, get next 2
-- Method 1:
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id LIMIT 2 OFFSET 2;

-- Method 2 (shortcut):
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id LIMIT 2, 2;
```

**Result:**
| id | name | price | category |
|----|------|-------|----------|
| 3 | Coffee Maker | 79.99 | Appliances |
| 4 | Headphones | 149.99 | Electronics |

##  Pagination Implementation

### Concept
Pagination divides large datasets into smaller, manageable pages.

### Generic Formula
```
OFFSET = (page_number - 1) × items_per_page
```

### Practical Example: 3 items per page

```sql
-- Page 1 (Items 1-3)
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3 OFFSET 0;
-- OR: SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 0, 3;

-- Page 2 (Items 4-6)
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3 OFFSET 3;
-- OR: SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3, 3;

-- Page 3 (Items 7-9)
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3 OFFSET 6;
-- OR: SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 6, 3;
```

### Programming Implementation
```sql
-- For any page number and page size:
SELECT * FROM products 
LIMIT (page_number - 1) * items_per_page, items_per_page;
```

---

##  Common Use Cases

### 1. Top N Results
```sql
-- Top 3 most expensive products
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY price DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 2. Random Selection
```sql
-- Get 5 random products
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 5;
```

### 3. Latest Records
```sql
-- Get 10 most recent products
SELECT * FROM products
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Sample Data for Testing
```sql
-- Get sample data for development/testing
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 5;
```

---

##  Performance Considerations

###  Problem with High OFFSET
```sql
--  SLOW: MySQL must process 1M rows even though it returns only 10
SELECT * FROM big_table
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 1000000, 10;
```

###  Better Alternative: Cursor-based Pagination
```sql
-- Instead of using high OFFSET, use WHERE clause
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE created_at > '2025-01-01 00:00:00'
ORDER BY created_at
LIMIT 10;
```

### Why OFFSET is Slow?
1. MySQL must **sort all records** first
2. Then **skip** the specified number of rows
3. Finally **return** the limited results
4. Higher offset = more processing time

##  Best Practices

###  DO's
- Always use `ORDER BY` with `LIMIT` for consistent results
- Use `LIMIT` on production servers to prevent overload
- Consider cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- Test with realistic data volumes

###  DON'Ts
- Avoid high OFFSET values on large tables
- Don't use `LIMIT` without `ORDER BY` for deterministic results
- Avoid `ORDER BY RAND()` on large tables (very slow)

### Safe Production Usage
```sql
-- Always include ORDER BY for predictable results
SELECT * FROM products 
ORDER BY id 
LIMIT 10;

-- Safe pagination approach
SELECT * FROM products 
WHERE id > last_seen_id 
ORDER BY id 
LIMIT 10;
```

##  Quick Reference

### Syntax Cheat Sheet
```sql
-- Basic LIMIT
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT n;

-- LIMIT with OFFSET (Method 1)
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT n OFFSET m;

-- LIMIT with OFFSET (Method 2)
SELECT * FROM table LIMIT m, n;

-- Pagination Formula
LIMIT (page_number - 1) * page_size, page_size
```

### Common Patterns
| Use Case | Query Pattern |
|----------|---------------|
| Top N | `ORDER BY column DESC LIMIT n` |
| Random N | `ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT n` |
| Page N | `LIMIT (n-1)*size, size` |
| Skip M, Get N | `LIMIT n OFFSET m` |

### Performance Tips
- **Small tables**: Any LIMIT/OFFSET works fine
- **Large tables**: Prefer WHERE conditions over high OFFSET
- **Random records**: Consider alternative approaches for large tables
- **Pagination**: Use cursor-based pagination for better performance
